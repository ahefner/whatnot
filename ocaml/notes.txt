The purpose of (setq merlin-use-auto-complete-mode 'easy), among other, is to disable automatic completion. Because it is cumbersome most of the time.

However, with some patience you can setup a friendly environment.

Reenable implicit completion:

 (setq merlin-use-auto-complete-mode t)
 Bind explicit invocation, just in case (some people prefer TAB):

(global-set-key (kbd "C-SPC") 'auto-complete)
